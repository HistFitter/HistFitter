---+++ Possible types for systematic uncertainties in HistFitter

We discussed already in the first part of this tutorial [[HistFitterTutorial#Systematic_uncertainties]] that HistFitter allows to implement systematic uncertainties as different types, depending on the effect the systematic uncertainty should have. In particular we introduced the types

   * =overallSys= if a systematic uncertainty only varies the scale of the nominal histogram
   * =histoSys= if the systematic uncertainty varies both the shape and the scale of a nominal histogram
   * =normHistoSys= if the systematic uncertainty only varies the shape of a nominal histogram

HistFitter provides much more possibilities to implement systematic uncertainties. The most common types (more types, in particular also user defined systematic uncertainties, exist) are:

| *Basic systematic methods in HistFactory* ||
| =overallSys= | uncertainty of the global normalization, not affecting the shape |
| =histoSys= | correlated uncertainty of shape and normalization |
| =shapeSys= | uncertainty of statistical nature applied to a sum of samples, bin by bin |
| *Additional systematic methods in HistFitter* ||
| =overallNormSys= | =overallSys= constrained to conserve total event count in a list of region(s) |
| =normHistoSys= | =histoSys= constrained to conserve total event count in a list of region(s) |
| =normHistoSysOneSide= | one-sided =normHistoSys= uncertainty built from tree-based |
| ^ | or weight-based inputs|
| =normHistoSysOneSideSym= | symmetrized =normHistoSysOneSide= |
| =overallHistoSys= | factorized normalization shape and uncertainty; described with |
| ^ | =overallSys= and =histoSys= respectively |
| =overallNormHistoSys= | =overallHistoSys= in which the shape uncertainty is modeled with a =normHistoSys= |
| ^ | and the global normalization uncertainty is modeled with an =overallSys= |
| =shapeStat= | =shapeSys= applied to an individual sample |

---+++ Which systematics type should be used?

Given these rather large amount of systematics types, one could get confused which type should be used in a certain situation. Alex Koutsman made a nice flowchart to illustrate the decision process.
