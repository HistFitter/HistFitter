2012-08-29 HistFitter Todo list

https://indico.cern.ch/conferenceDisplay.py?confId=204995




Zach:
- Better rejection of bad fits that make it into grid list file (Zach had some tricks for this - discuss)
- Correct statistical treatment of fits to prescaled data.
- Treatment of negative QCD weights: can lead to crash in signal region. 
- Hard-coded names, e.g. sig_xsection. Needs to be documented, or made flexible.
- Scripts for plotting the new theoretical error. Properly available and documented?
- Sharing of common scripts: e.g. p0 calculation, making pull plots, drawing pdf, contour plots.
- Directory driven results structure
- FAQ on failed fits and how to handle them. 
- Guideline of when a fit / grid-of-fits is okay.


Michael:
- the choice of nuisance parameters in blind analyses 
- and expected limits (from some mails I saw that this is currently implemented/ investigated)
- one sided uncertainties or in general propagation of uncertainties from performance groups

Sophie & Marcello:
- Absolute errors in case of nominal prediction with 0.0 events. Empty nominal, non-empty systematic
- When using histogram inputs, specify the range of the input histograms to be used (used to be supported by RooStats?)
- Cleanup of python code: propose derived classes for various available systematics
- More debugging output 
- Sharing of analysis scripts. 
   Eg. batch submission scripts.
   Systematics table with each individual systematic turned off (iterate)
- UL derived with toys. RooFit crash.
- better support for histogram based running

Jeanette:
- For optimization studies, possibility to propagate cut-values to output files/dir
- Make contour plot as a HistFitter option? I.e. combine all steps into one?

Sigve:
- RooFit Toys generation/fitting crash
- Memory leak for running toys (?)
- FAQ would be useful to have.
- Analysis script sharing?
- General remark: ROOT plotting scripts can be difficult

Geert-Jan:
- Merge 0-lepton fitter changes into HistFitter trunk
- Mem-leak for running over many grid-points? (Jeanette says no.)
- Update to Root v5.34
- Implement HistFitter xml-python hooks -- apparently need input from George Lewis

Jovan:
- Encourage more support for using histograms directly instead of trees, 
  such as having a standard way to configure histogram files and names.

Alex:
- Histogram recycle option with running with -t.
   (Do per channel?)
- How to deal with bin with 0 bkg-prediction content, include it in the fit or not?
- Verbose: _correct_ list of input histograms to be used by histfactory
- Quoting ofr correct MC stat errors in tables -> constact RooStats. 
- Asymmetric error propagation
- VisualizeERror bug for single bin, still to be fixed by Wouter

David:
- magic words for cmd line option. python -c "foo=True"
- automated histogram fix (zero entries) --> configurable, logging info
- swapping of one-sided up/down-systematics fixed? 
- Blinding -> put in again.
- Support for absolute errors. 
- histograms as input: name specifiable, and -v2 option needs to be exact.
- batch system support
- 0-lepton: switching between multiple signal regions.
- Generalized script for visible x-section limits (by Alex)
- Finish polymorphism for systematics ("methods")
- Merge measurement class with TopLevelXML
- asymmetric binning

Max:
- Documentation needs cleanup.
- Documentation of various available systematics.
- Tutorial uptodate? Do all tutorial examples work? Need to check (I believe they do.)
- Cleanup of python code
- Request for FAQ
- Upgrade to ROOT v5.34; xml files okay?
- New histogram interpolation default in latest root version.
- Divergence of code:
- Blinding  currently only in configMananger.py_blinding

- Merge 0-lepton code into HistFitter
   Cmd line options: choose between exclusion/discovery/bkg-only fits
   Cmd line options: Choose which signal region to run on.
   Renormalization of systematics over control regions 
   Useful scripts for merging latex tables

- Readdition of symmetrization of systematic errors.

- Correct statistical treatment of weighted (pre-scaled) datasets
   Razor analysis.

- Recommit logicalOR.py script.
- Presentation of MC stat errors in Tables.
- Commit HistFitter code in ROOT
- Lets share our table/plot/submission scripts. Eg. Pull plots
- Manpower situation. Rotation schedule for Histfitter support and mailing list
